                <h3>Small Group</h3>
                <p>
                    We specialize in small groups and custom crafted independent tours. Our group departures are
                    guaranteed with a minimum of
                    two sign-ups. We keep our groups small, usually less than ten persons, so that each participant
                    receives personal attention
                    from their guides and support staff. Small group travel allows our traveler's flexibility in
                    itineraries and access to areas and sights unknown or unavailable to large tour
                    groups—plus you have more independence and opportunity to socialize and share your experience with
                    other participants.

                <h3>Travel with locals</h3>
                <p>Our trips are escorted by locally gifted and talented guides who are university graduates, certified
                    by the local government,
                    are fluent in English and will act as your personal translator. They are professional, but are also
                    easy going, friendly and
                    hardworking. Using local guides, we not only provide jobs to the locals, but also save on the high
                    cost of providing
                    a foreign guide. Most importantly, no matter how much expertise a foreigner can have on an area or
                    people,
                    there is no match for local knowledge.</p>

                <h3>Lifetime Deposit</h3>
                <p>We understand that circumstances and preferences can change over time and you may not be able to go
                    on the trip you have
                    signed up for. No worries. You will not lose your deposit. While the deposit is non refundable, you
                    can use it on your
                    future travel on any destinations we go. The deposit also can be transferred to another traveler.
                    But if some suppliers
                    such as hotels have asked a non refundable deposit, we may not be able to recover it when you can
                    cancel or postpone the trip.</p>

            <section class="section_flex">
                <h3>Safety</h3>
                <p>All of our guides and support crews are trained in safety and first aid techniques. On adventurous
                    trips, our guides and
                    crews use modern equipment. Our itineraries involving high altitude allow enough time for
                    acclimatization. In the event
                    of altitude sickness, we carry portable oxygen bottles and pressure chambers in our jeeps for high
                    altitude trips, like
                    Mount Kailash. We always use purified water for drinking and cooking.

                    We continuously keep eyes on the political and social conditions in the countries we visit, and we
                    do not operate trips
                    in politically and socially disturbed areas.</p>

                <h3>Low Impact of Tourism</h3>
                <p>As you go through our trips, you will very quickly feel the vital need for preserving the local
                    culture and environment.
                    We do our best to leave a minimum impact on the culture, environment, and biodiversity of remote
                    highlands. It plays
                    an essential role in helping to increase awareness to the outside world, as well to the local people
                    of the need to
                    preserve these areas for future generations, rather than exploit them now for short term economic
                    gain.
                    We do our very best to ensure that local populations in the areas we visit benefit directly from our
                    tours..</p>
