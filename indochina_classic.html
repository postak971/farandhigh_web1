                        <p>No strenuous hiking or trekking! We travel by a comfortable minivan or bus up to Rongbuk
                            Monastery, and then we switch to an eco shuttle to the base camp. Roads are all paved
                            through
                            the base camp! We enjoy unobstructed views of the highest mountain on earth, from top to
                            bottom-
                            a sight unseen on the Nepal side even after several days of strenuous trekking. We also get
                            a
                            close-up view of other 8000-meter high mountains such as Lhotse, Cho Oyu, Makalu, and more,
                            all

                    <h3>Itineray</h3>
                    <h4>Day 01~Arrive in Lhasa, Tibet</h4>

                    <p>Flights to Lhasa arrive from Kathmandu (Nepal) or Chengdu (China) or other major Chinese cities
                        with
                        a possible stop in Chengdu. Airfare and airport transfer is not included and booked separately.

                        Upon arrival, meet your guide and driver and transfer to the hotel in Lhasa City (47 miles, 1
                        hr.).
                        <br>
                        Check into the hotel and take rest for acclimatization. You are likely to experience mild
                        symptoms
                        of altitude sickness that
                        include but not limited to headache, dizziness, nausea, disorientation, breathlessness,
                        dehydration,
                        etc. Drink plenty of water
                        and take liquid food in meals.<br>
                        Overnight: Dekhang Hotel</p>
                    <h4>Day 02~Potala Palace and Sera Monastery</h4>
                    <p>We visit Potala Palace in the morning and afternoon, visit Sera Monastery.

                        The world-famous Potala Palace of the Dalai Lama is located on "Red Hill" to the west of old
                        Lhasa
                        and was the seat of the Tibetan government. With chapels, cells, schools for religious classes,
                        and
                        tombs of Dalai Lamas, it was a self-contained world. Kora (pilgrimage path) hike of Potala that
                        encircles the foot of the palace is a lovely walk and an enjoyable experience.
                        <br>
                        After the lunch break, we will head to Sera Monastery, the last of the three principal Yellow
                        Sect
                        monasteries to be built in
                        Lhasa. Sera means” Hailstone” in Tibet, and legend tells that it hailed during the foundation of
                        this famous monastery.
                        Sera comprise a great sutra chanting hall, a college, and 32 sections. It once housed nearly
                        10,000
                        monks and is proud of its
                        glorious history during the Ming Dynasty. At Sera, we will take the chance to watch the monks
                        debating session.<br>
                        Overnight: Dekhang Hotel<br />
                        Meals : Breakfast</p>
                    <h4>Day 03~Excursion of Drak Yerpa Hermitage</h4>
                    <p>After breakfast, we are off to the Drak Yerpa Hermitage- nearly 12 miles east from the city. Many
                        Buddhist teachers, including Guru Rinpoche and King Songtsen Gampo, meditated here, so, the cave
                        hermitages here are among the holiest retreats in Tibet. They say there are 108 sacred cave
                        hermitages. So, depending on your interest, we can spend a few hours here or spend the entire
                        day
                        exploring the holy caves where Buddhist saints and Dalai Lama meditated. While the sites have a
                        religious significance, Drak Yerpa is also known for its natural beauty. The place is peaceful
                        with
                        stunning views and an experience of rural Tibet that is away from the crowds of Lhasa.
                        <br>
                        In the afternoon, we head back to Lhasa and visit Barkhor Street- the old Tibetan town where we
                        will
                        have a lunch break
                        (lunch not provided). After lunch, we will visit the ancient Jokhang Temple. It was built by
                        King
                        Songtsen Gampo in the 7th
                        century to house the image of Buddha brought to Tibet by his Nepali wife Bhrikuti as part of the
                        dowry. After that, we will
                        take a relaxed stroll on the pilgrimage path of Barkhor that goes around the Jokhang Temple.
                        Barkhor
                        area has authentic Tibetan
                        characteristics with Tibetan shops lining up on either side of the street. We will see devout
                        Tibetans walking and spinning the
                        prayer wheels or counting the holy beads and uttering the sacred Buddhist mantras-'Om Mane Padme
                        Hum!'<br>
                        Overnight: Dekhang Hotel<br>
                        Meals : Breakfast</p>
                    <h4>Day 04~Gyantse and Shigatse</h4>
                    <p>214 miles, 7 hours<br>

                        Following breakfast, we set out on the high roads of Tibet; today, we cross two high passes the
                        Kamba La (15,700 ft) and
                        Karo La (16,500 ft). A pass is a sacred place for Tibetans, and each time they travel over a
                        pass,
                        they stop here to offer
                        the prayer flags and wish for a safe journey! The passes also provide views over the vast
                        Tibetan
                        plateau and the Himalayan
                        mountains. Often time, we can also see Tibetan people with their decorated yaks. You can ride
                        the
                        yak and pose for a picture
                        for a nominal fee!

                        After Kambala Pass, the road drops and follows the shores of beautiful Yamdrok Tsho Lake-one of
                        the
                        holiest lakes in Tibet.
                        In about five hours or a little more, we arrive in Gyantse-a picturesque Tibetan town. In
                        Gyantse,
                        we visit the Kumbum Stupa
                        -a multi-storied aggregate of Buddhist chapels. And visit adjoining Pelkore Chode Monastery,
                        also
                        known as Palco Monastery,
                        which is believed to exist since the 9th century, even before the town was built. <br>

                        We continue on our travel to Shigatse, the second-largest city in Tibet. The road passes through
                        the
                        fertile Nyanchu Valley
                        with a vast agricultural plain. Along the way, you might see the Tibetan farmers at work.<br>

                    <h4>Day 05~Rongbuk Monastery and Everest Base Camp</h4>
                    <p>Another long day of driving, yet the journey is equally rewarding! The road trip involves the
                        crossing of two high passes, the Tropu La (16,236 ft) and Gyatso La (17,122 ft). These pass cuts
                        through several picturesque villages and will have spectacular mountain views all the time.
                        After a lunch break in Shegar, we leave the main highway and head up north to Dza Rongbuk
                        Monastery.
                        The journey involves crossing over Pang La (5120m/16,794 ft) that rewards you with the views of
                        several 8000m high mountains like Makalu, Lhotse, Cho Oyu, and Mount Everest. The road passes
                        through several picturesque villages.
                        <br>
                        Upon arrival at Rongbuk, check-in the monastery guesthouse that offers simple accommodation with
                        a
                        shared Tibetan style pit toilet
                        with no running water! If it's not a cloudy day, you will enjoy gorgeous views of Mount
                        Everest.<br>

                        didn't
                        visit the base camp, you have a chance this morning, and usually, you have better and
                        unobstructed
                        views in the morning.
                        <br>
                        After breakfast, retrace drive to the main highway and continue on a long journey to

                        Check-in hotel and balance of the day is free for you to take rest or take a stroll in the

                        in China. We will obtain

                        Beijing).
                        You need to present this
                        document when you check-in for the flight to Lhasa.
                        Your Guide will be holding all other necessary permits required for this trip.</p>
                    <h4>Accommodation & meals</h4>
                    <p>In Lhasa, we will book a mid-range tourist standard hotel in Barkhor Area. Our choices of hotels
                        are
                        Dhekhang, Kyichu,
                        or Gorkha Hotel, located in the old Tibetan quarter of Lhasa. These are locally managed mid-size
                        properties with an
                        adequate comfort level. There are a few four stars and 5-star hotels such as 4-Points By
                        Sheraton,
                        Shangrila Hotel,
                        St. Regis, etc. and we can book them for you on an additional cost. In Shigatse also, we book a
                        local three-star hotel.
                        Accommodation in Rongbuk is rudimentary. The toilet is a Tibetan style squat with no running
                        water.
                        There is no shower
                        here. Hotels in Tibet provide limited supplies of toiletries, and so, please bring your own set.
                        They may not also have a
                        hairdryer, iron, and ironing boards. If the preferred hotels listed in the program are not
                        available, we will book the
                        next best possible property in that price category.<br>
                        Most hotels in Lhasa and Shigatse provide with WiFi, but some hotels may charge some nominal fee
                        for
                        using the WiFi.
                        Food<br>

                        The trip cost includes breakfast only. The hotels serve Chinese, Tibetan, Indian, Nepali, and
                        western-style breakfasts.
                        The trip does not include lunch and dinner and so budget $10-12 for a meal. You may want to
                        bring
                        some dry fruits, chocolates,
                        energy bars, vitamin supplements, etc.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Roads and Transportation</h4>
                    <p>Now the road in Tibet is in good condition! They are all paved through the basecamp. However,
                        vehicles have to stop at
                        Rongbuk Monastery- the last point you can get by car. Depending on the final group size, we use
                        a
                        minivan or coaster bus all
                        transfers and tours. Bring a protection mask for
                        your nose to avoid inhaling dust! The driver may or may not speak English, but he knows the
                        Tibetan
                        roads and will be an
                        experienced one.</p>
                    <h4>Tour Guide</h4>
                    <p> You will be accompanied by experienced and knowledgeable English speaking Tibetan Guide who you
                        meet
                        on arrival at Lhasa
                        airport. Besides guiding you on tour, your guide will also be responsible for dealing with check
                        posts, and local bureaucracies and
                        complete necessary paperwork. Guide and driver are different persons.</p>
                    <h4>Altitude sickness and Health Issues</h4>
                    <p>There are no mandatory vaccinations required for traveling to China and Tibet unless you have
                        visited
                        any yellow fever affected
                        areas in the last six months. However, you may consider protection against rabies Hep A,
                        Typhoid,
                        etc. Travelers with cardiac-pulmonary
                        issues or any other medical conditions are recommended to consult their physician. The primary
                        health consideration in Tibet is altitude-related
                        illness or Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). You may experience some mild symptoms initially, such
                        as
                        headache, lethargy, nausea, and sleeplessness,
                        but these should lessen within a few days.

                        Although the trip doesn't expect you to be athletic, you will be glad if you are fit. So,
                        please,
                        start some physical exercises like jogging,
                        swimming, cycling, hiking, etc. about several weeks before the trip.</p>

                    <h4>Booking and cancellation</h4>
                    <p>We request a deposit of US$300 along with a completed trip application form and passport copies.
                        If
                        you need us to book the airfare to Lhasa,
                        we will give you the quote.
                        The final payment is due 90 days before the trip date. Balance payment on credit card attracts
                        an
