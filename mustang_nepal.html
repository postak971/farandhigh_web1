                <div class="overview_flex">
                    <p>On this trip, we take you to Mustang, a lost Tibetan Kingdom in the Himalaya.
                        Situated high in the Tibetan plateau and surrounded by the Himalayan mountains,
                        Mustang is truly a kingdom in the sky. Mustang offers rugged terrain, magnificent landscapes,
                        barren ridges,
                        deep canyons, eroded cliffs, and moraine valleys. Tibetan style villages, ancient monasteries,
                        and chortens intersperse
                        throughout the region, and we can experience the authentic Buddhist religion and culture in this
                        forbidden land.

                <h3>Itineray</h3>
                <h4>Day 01~ Arrive in Kathmandu, Nepal</h4>

                <p>You arrive in Kathmandu on your own. You can apply for Nepal visa on arrival! Bring one passport-type
                    picture
                    and cash US$ 30 to pay in visa fee.
                    After completing immigration and customs formalities, meet your guide at the arrival gate and
                    transfer to the hotel.</p>

                <h4>Day 02~ A free day in Kathmandu for optional sightseeing</h4>
                <p>You have a free day in Kathmandu while we obtain your necessary travel permits to Mustang (Mustang
                    Special Area Permit
                    and Annapurna Conservation Area). The trip cost includes permit fees. You can take rest or book an
                    optional sightseeing tour.
                    A car with a driver and an English speaking guide costs $ 70 for a full day sightseeing (7 or 8
                    hours) if you wish to book. </p>

                <h4>Day 03~ Travel by road to Pokhara</h4>
                <p>(125 miles, 6 or 7 hours).

                    Note: If you wish, you can take a 25 minutes long flight for $ 135 (including airport transfers)

                    Together with your guide, travel to Pokhara by a comfortable tourist coach. It's a scenic
                    journey on the mountainous road that allows you to see the rural countryside of Nepal. Along
                    the way, enjoy the greeneries, terraced farms, quaint villages, roadside settlements, and occasional
                    view of snow-capped mountains!

                    Upon arrival in Pokhara, transfer to the hotel for check-in. Balance of the day is for rest as we
                    prepare for the big adventure ahead.</p>

                <h4>Day 04~ By flight to Jomsom</h4>
                <i> (20 minutes long flight. Jomsom elevation (Elevation 9,000 ft.)</i>

                <p>Early morning breakfast and transfer to the airport in time for the flight to Jomsom.
                    If the weather goes well, the flight takes off in time, and we arrive in Jomsom around 8 a.m.
                </p>
                <p><b>Hike to Thini Gaon, Dhumba Lake and Marpha Village ( 8, 692 ft.) </b></p>
                <p>
                    We start our trek and arrive in a small picturesque village of Thini in about 30 minutes.
                    Thini is the oldest village in the valley and features an old Buddhist Gompa (previously a Bon
                    monastery).
                    Now, we follow the trail that drops down and crosses the Lungpuhyun Khola River and then ascends the
                    other side.
                    We pass by the hilltop ruins of Gharab Dzong fortress and beyond is the pretty, prayer flag
                    festooned sacred Dhumba
                    Lake at 9, 282ft. Hike up the ridge above the lake to the Katsapterenga Gompa for a 360-degree view
                    of Nilgiri peak,
                    Tilicho Pass, Syang village and Thini and Jomsom below you.
                </p>
                <p>We continue walking through the picturesque villages with interspersed monasteries, tea-shops, cross
                    the Kali Gandaki
                    River and arrive at the beautiful village of Marpha. Marpha is a lovely village with paved streets
                    and well- kept,
                    whitewashed houses, surrounded by fertile fields and orchards. We spend the balance of the day
                    exploring the village.
                    Be sure to try some locally grown apples if you are here in the autumn and maybe the apple brandy!
                    The monastery of the village is also worth a visit. </p>
                <p><b>Roadtrip option:</b> The flight from Pokhara to Jomsom is very much weather-bound. There is the
                    strong wind in Jomsom
                    that starts to blow mid-morning and makes impossible for the planes to land. So all the planes have
                    to land and
                    take off before the wind begins! If the flight gets canceled, then we have no other option than to
                    take a road trip. And we make in two days of a reasonable amount of drive; five or six hours a day.
                    And we can
                    still catch up the itinerary as planned. </p>

                <h4>Day 05~ By 4WD to Muktinath and Kagbeni</h4>
                <p><i>Muktinath ( Elevation 12, 464 ft) Kagbeni ( Elevation 9, 512 ft)</i></p>
                <p>After breakfast, we meet our driver and ride back to the Pokhara-Jomsom highway and continue to
                    Kagbeni and then to Muktinath
                    ( Total drive 25 miles).
                </p>
                <p>On the way to Muktinath, we stop in the village of Jharkot and visit its ruined palace, a monastery,
                    and Tibetan healing center.
                    Finally, we arrive at the temple of Muktinath-a Hindu temple dedicated to
                    Lord Bishnu but equally revered by Buddhist as well. We enjoy the incredible views of Dhaulagiri,
                    Nilgiri, and Tukuche Peak.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, we retrace our journey back to Kagbeni. Set beside the Kali Gandaki River, Kagbeni
                    is the gateway to Upper Mustang. We check into our guesthouse and the balance of the day is for
                    exploration of this picturesque Tibetan village. We browse through narrow walkways and passageways
                    that squeeze beneath buildings and pass by the Chortens and prayer wheels
                    here and there. You can spend some time at the village's monastery that now primarily
                    serves as a primary school. But you can still observe the Tibetan
                    artifacts and worship ceremonies, called 'puja.' </p>


                <h4>Day 06~ By 4WD to Ghami</h4>
                <p><i>Ghami Villag (Elevation: 11, 448 ft)</i></p>
                <p>Today, we enter the restricted area of Upper Mustang.
                    First, we have our permit checked at the entry post,
                    and then we begin our road adventures. The jeep track
                    skirts the side of the Kali Gandaki River Valley.
                    Along the way, we stop and explore the small
                    villages and see the carefully tended terraced fields.
                    It's amazing to see how there are fields flooded in such
                    landscape that is otherwise dry and barren wilderness.</p>


                <p>At Chusang there is a river tributary to cross and shortly after that
                    the Kali Gandaki River bed itself. Now, the road climbs and crosses
                    some high passes before it descends to Ghami Village where we
                    overnight today. The Syngboche Pass, which is at the elevation of
                    13, 776 ft, offers a fantastic view of the vast Trans Himalayan
                    region. </p>
                <p>Today, we travel 20 miles in six hours!</p>
                <h4>Day 07~ Lo Manthang- The Capital of Mustang</h4>
                <p><i>Altitude 12,595 ft</i></p>
                <p>Today, we finally make to the capital city Lo-Manthang of the lost
                    Tibetan Kingdom of Mustang. We cruise through the vast
                    mountain-desert, cross quite a few high passes and enjoy the
                    magnificent view of Nilgiri, Tilicho, Annapurna and other peaks.
                    Along the way, we stop to visit the Ghar Gompa-a significant
                    monastery of Mustang and Charang
                    Village-the second largest settlement of Mustang, after Lo
                    Manthang.</p>
                <p>Once in Lo Manthang, we check into our accommodation and soon
                    set out to explore the local highlights. Lo Manthang was the
                    walled capital of the kingdom of Lo-founded in the 14th century!
                    The kingdom came under the Shah rulers of Nepal in the
                    18th century, but the hereditary rulers were allowed to continue!</p>
                <p>Today, we visit the Jampa Gompa -the oldest monastery built in the
                    early 15th century, Thubchen Gompa- a vast, red assembly hall and
                    gompa built in the late 15th century. And also Chodey Gompa-which
                    is now the leading city gompa and the monastic museum. Caravans of
                    domesticated yaks and sheep are frequent sights. We will also visit
                    the king's palace and observe other local activities in the town. </p>
                <p>Today, we drive about 11 miles in three hours!</p>
                <h4>Day 08~ Explore Lo Mathang and the area around.</h4>
                <p>
                    Today, we take an excursion of the attractions around Lo Manthang.
                    We visit the Namgyal Gompa, the sky caves of Chhosar and the 3,000-
                    year-old Shija Jhong Cave. There are several other high cliff
                    caves which were used for burial, meditation and also as a dwelling.
                </p>
                <h4>Day 09~ Return to Chhusang</h4>
                <p>While it's possible to drive back to Jomsom on a long day,
                    it may be exhaustive and so
                    we overnight in Chusang village which should take
                    about six hours. </p>
                <h4>Day 10~ Back to Jomsom</h4>

                <p>While it's possible to drive back to Jomsom on a long day,
                    it may be exhaust
                    so we overnight in Chusang village which should take about six hours. </p>
                <h4>Day 11-12~ By flight to Pokhara and an additional day for optional sightseeing</h4>
                <p>Luckily, the plane from Pokhara touches down at the
                    Jomsom airport this morning, and we fly to Pokhara today.</p>
                <p><b>Road trip alternative:</b> If the flight gets canceled, we take a long day road trip to Pokhara.
                    While it's possible to make it in a single day to Pokhara,
                    we might break the journey in Tatopani or Beni tonight. </p>
                <p> If we are lucky with the flight and we arrive in Pokhara as planned, we
                    have an extra day in Pokhara for rest or optional sightseeing.
                    Pokhara is a relaxed city and you can explore the local attractions on your own
                    or hire a car with driver and an English speaking
                    guide costs US$ 70.</p>
                <h4>Day 13~ Travel back to Kathmandu</h4>
                <p>After breakfast, we take the tourist coach back to Kathmandu.
                    If you wish, you can buy
                    a plane ticket for $ 130, including airport transfers. </p>
                <h4>Day 14 ~Depart Kathmandu</h4>
                <p>After breakfast, service ends. If you are departing Kathmandu today, you will
                    be dropped off at the airport.
                </p>

                    There are all the costs included.</p>
                <h4>Accommodation & meals</h4>
                <p>Accommodation in Kathmandu and Pokhara will be in mid-range, comfortable three-star hotels. 
                    You will have a private bathroom with 24-hours running hot and cold water. Amenities include electric kettle with tea and coffee pouches, 
                    wireless or cabled internet, television, necessary toiletry supplies, etc.</p>
                    <p>Once we leave the cities, accommodation will be in 
                        trekking lodges or guesthouses which are popularly known as 'tea-houses.' A tea-house is a mom-and-pop establishment where they have a 
                        few rooms for the guests. Rooms are simple with two or three beds, provided with futon or foam mattresses, bed cover, pillows, and a quilt 
                        or blanket. The bed sheets, pillowcases, quilt cases, linens, etc. are generally clean. But still may show stains as all the linens are hand-washed 
                        with cold water and weather is extreme in the Himalaya. Some travelers prefer to bring sleeping bags on their own. If you need it, we can also provide
                         you one for use in the trip. You may also consider bringing linen sprays to use on the bedding if you are sensitive.</p>
                         <p>Each guesthouse has two or three toilets and a bathing room which you share with the family and other guests in the house. 
                             They are generally clean. While some of them have a western-style commode, many are local squat-style, and they may not have the flush.
                              After use, you need to pour water in to clean it. You need to bring toilet paper for your use.</p>
                              <p>Some newer guest houses have a shower, 
                    but many traditional guesthouses do not have one. They provide you a bucket of hot water and a jug for bathing and charge a nominal fee.</p>
                    <p>The trip features three meals a day when you are in the Mustang region. The tea-house menu lists a range of food such as noodles, spaghetti, 
                        rice dishes, potatoes, eggs, bread, soups, seasonable vegetable items and some sweet dishes such as apple pies, pancakes, puddings, custards, etc. 
                        They also attempt to make pizzas and bakeries! The most popular food, readily available is 'dal that' which is a platter of steamed rice, curried vegetable, 
                        lentil soup, and chutney. Momo-a steamed dumpling stuffed with ground meat, vegetable and herbs are also special! You won't find many meat dishes in the mountain, 
                        and they are pricy even found. So, bring sufficient protein supplement. On the beverage side, you can find hot tea, instant coffee, hot lemon, hot chocolates, 
                        sodas, beer, and local liquors, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>You will eat breakfast and dinner, usually at your guesthouse and lunch in a roadside inn along the way. 
                            If you are a couple or a family or a small group, your guide may hand you in each a la carte menu, and you can choose your food. Do not be surprised 
                            if the item listed in the menu is not available! During the busy season and if you are a group, then your guide orders the same food for everyone
                             unless you have a special dietary requirement. This is to save time and the fact that the owner can not handle many orders at a time. Usually, your 
                             meal course includes an appetizer, a main dish, and a dessert item, followed by a cup of tea or coffee. You need to pay out of pocket if you order 
                             a soda, beer, or any alcoholic beverages! (Consuming an alcoholic drink at a high altitude is not a good idea!). There are no western trained chefs. 
                             However, they do their best. Do not be surprised 
                        if the food that has a western sounding name tastes different than you expected!&nbsp;</p>

                <h4>Roads and Transportation</h4>
                <p>The drive from Kathmandu to Pokhara is smooth with exception to some potholes and damages in the landslide-prone areas. Currently, some portion of the way is on the process of widening.</p><p>The Mustang region, which is a mountain desert has no proper roads. We travel on the gravel roads bulldozed on the cliff-side and tracks in the flat areas. Quite a few times we cross the streams without bridges! So, it's going to be a bumpy drive and also could be dusty. But we care about is the magnificent views of the landscape, mountains, sceneries, quaint villages and experiencing the Buddhist culture! This adventure is certainly not for individuals with back-ache issues.</p><p>We are trying to use flight for transportation between Pokhara and Jomsom, but we do not have luck with the weather sometimes. Jomsom experiences very high wind that starts blowing in the mid-morning, and after that, it becomes impossible for the planes to land and take off. So, the aircraft departs Pokhara between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. In case the weather goes wrong, there will be no flight, and we have to take the road trip to Jomsom, which takes two long days of the drive. The road is smooth until Beni (five or six hours) and then it's a gravel and dirt road bulldozed on the high gorge side and it can be scary for some! The refund of the airfare covers the cost of the alternative road trip.&nbsp;</p><p>We use Japanese made 4WD Toyota Landcruiser or Indian made Mahindra Scorpio for the road trip to Mustang. These diesel engine vehicles are perfect for mountainous terrain and off-road adventures. These vehicles perform very well on the roads with sharp bends and steep ascents and descents. For the transportation between Kathmandu 
                    and Pokhara, we use comfortable tourist class coach and a sedan car for all airport transfers in Kathmandu.</p>
                <h4>Tour Guide</h4>
                <p> You will be accompanied by experienced and knowledgeable English speaking Guide who you meet
                    on arrival at Kathmandu airport. Besides guiding you on tour, your guide will also be responsible for dealing with check
                    posts, and local bureaucracies and
                    complete necessary paperwork. Guide and driver are different persons.</p>
                <h4>Vaccination and Health Issues</h4>
                <p>There are no mandatory vaccinations required for traveling to Nepal unless you have visited
                    any yellow fever affected
                    areas in the last six months. However, you may consider protection against rabies Hep A, Typhoid,
                    etc. Travelers with cardiac-pulmonary
                    issues or any other medical conditions are recommended to consult their physician. The primary
                    health consideration in Tibet is altitude-related
                    illness or Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). You may experience some mild symptoms initially, such as
                    headache, lethargy, nausea, and sleeplessness,
                    but these should lessen within a few days.

                    Although the trip doesn't expect you to be athletic, you will be glad if you are fit. So, please,
                    start some physical exercises like jogging,
                    swimming, cycling, hiking, etc. about several weeks before the trip.</p>

                <h4>Booking and cancellation</h4>
                <p>We request a deposit of US$300 along with a completed trip application form and passport copies. If
                    you need us to book the airfare to Lhasa,
                    we will give you the quote.
                    The final payment is due 90 days before the trip date. Balance payment on credit card attracts an
                    additional 3.5% fee.</p>
