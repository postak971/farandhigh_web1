                    <p>On this trip, we trek on the Nabji-Korphu trail in the Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, take

                        KorphuTrail and the Manas National Park receive very few foreign travelers, and so these areas
                        are mostly unexplored.

                <h3>Itineray</h3>
                <h4>Day 01~Arrive in Paro, Bhutan</h4>

                Flights to Paro (altitude 7,380 feet, or 2,250 meters) arrive from Kathmandu or Bangkok or Delhi. Please
                allow at
                least one night in those cities before and after your trip to ensure a safe connection with flights to
                and from Bhutan.
                Please arrange your international airfare to the gateway city; Far &amp; High will book the onward
                flight for you. Your
                Bhutan visa is part of the tour. We will email it to you in advance, as you’ll need it at check-in for
                your flight to Bhutan
                and again upon arrival at the Paro airport, where your passport will get its final visa seal. After
                completing immigration and
                customs formalities, your guide and driver will meet you outside the terminal and transfer you to a
                restaurant in the town for
                lunch.<br><br>After lunch, your guide will lead explorations of Paro. We begin from
                the&nbsp;<strong>National Museum</strong>
                &nbsp;housed at Ta Dzong, which served as a watchtower for the&nbsp;
                <strong>Rinpung Dzong</strong>&nbsp;(a dzong is a fortress and a religious and social center).
                The museum has a beautiful collection of books, murals, Bhutanese textiles, crafts, weapons,
                olden utensils, stuffed animals, and a rich philatelic collection. From here, we descend to Rinpung
                Dzong, which is the district headquarters and also the seat of the district's religious body.</p>
                <p>Now, we proceed on an hour-long scenic drive to Thimphu with a stop for a short walk at the
                    13th-century temple of&nbsp;<strong>
                        Tamchog Lakhang which</strong>&nbsp;was built by the famous Tibetan iron-bridge builder
                    Thangthong Gyalpo – architect,
                    physician, teacher, and a saint! The temple is owned and maintained by his descendants.</p>
                <p>In Thimphu, we’ll have time to settle in and take some rest before a walking tour of the tiny city.
                    Thimphu is probably the only capital in the world without any traffic lights! We will leisurely take
                    a
                    stroll and visit the&nbsp;<strong>memorial Chorten</strong>&nbsp;(shrine)
                    of the 3rd King of Bhutan Jigme Dorje Wangchuk, and whatever else time and our interest allow.</p>
                <h4>Day 02~ Sightseeing and hiking in Thimphu</h4>
                <p>After breakfast, we are off for sightseeing and hiking. We have a lot to see today! Depending on your
                    interest,
                    pace and available time, we may or may not visit all the sights listed below.</p>
                <p>We first visit the <strong>weekend
                        market</strong> of Thimphu, if we are here during the weekend. Farmers from the neighboring
                    villages come to sell
                    their fresh produce. We will also visit the <strong>archery</strong> field to see the national
                    sports of Bhutan.<br>
                    <br>Next, we can visit the National Institute Zorig Chusum that offers a six-year course on Bhutan's
                    traditional arts
                    and crafts, including painting, wood carving, embroidery, and statue making. Then we can head to
                    the&nbsp;<strong>Simply
                        Bhutan Museum</strong>&nbsp;resembles a typical Bhutanese village with demonstrations and
                    performances on Bhutan's
                    arts,&nbsp;culture, and lifestyle. Here, you can try Bhutanese costumes and&nbsp;pose for
                    photographs!<br> <br>Next, we can visit the <strong>Takin Sanctuary</strong>. Takin&nbsp;– a kind of
                    sheep by way of antelope — are the National animals of Bhutan and believed to exist only in Bhutan
                    Himalaya. On the way back, stop at the<strong> Zilukha Nunnery</strong> in Drubthob Goemba, home to
                    40-60 Buddhist nuns.<br> <br>We can visit the <strong>Gagyel Lhundrup Weaving Center</strong>, which
                    produces traditional hand-woven textiles and has a selection of cloth and ready-made garments for
                    sale. Here, you can see the local women working their looms.&nbsp;<br> <br>Next, visit the
                    <strong>Changangkha Temple</strong>, one of the oldest in Thimphu, built in the 12th Century. The
                    temple houses Chenrizig (Avolokitesawara), an 11-headed, thousand-armed manifestation as the central
                    statue.&nbsp;<br> <br>In the afternoon, we can visit the World’s Largest Buddha Image —
                    <strong>Buddha Dordenma</strong>, situated atop a hill overlooking the Thimphu Valley-the latest
                    addition to Thimphu's attractions. This massive 169 feet tall image has a three-story base that
                    houses a large chapel, while the body itself contains 125,000 smaller Buddha statues.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br><strong>An option:</strong>&nbsp;Hiking enthusiasts keen to experience monastic lives away from
                    the crowds of town can take a half-day hike to Tango Goemba monastery-with a trade-off with some
                    sights listed above. Tango Goema Monastery is Bhutan's highest learning center for Buddhist studies.
                    All Je Khenpo, the religious head of Bhutan, must complete a nine-year program here, including a
                    three-year, three-month, three-day course in mediation at the nearby Cheri Goemba Monastery! With
                    luck, the monks will be in recess, and we can join them for tea. (Note: on a group tour, there must
                    be a unanimous decision to take this hike.)</p>
                <p>Interested in the <strong>Buddhist astrology</strong>? On our way back, we can stop at&nbsp;Pangri
                    Zampa Temple-an astrology school for the state clergy. More than a hundred monks study astrology in
                    this center, and they&nbsp;welcome the public for astrology consultation if anyone is interested. A
                    week-advance notice is requested for scheduling purpose, though.
                <h4>Day 03~ A long day drive to Phobjikha Valley</h4>
                <p>(85 miles, 6 hours).</p>
                <p>After an early breakfast, we leave for Phobjhikha Valley.</p>
                <p>As we leave Thimphu behind, the road gradually winds up through villages and pine forests
                    to&nbsp;<strong>Dochula Pass&nbsp;

                    </strong>(3100m/10168 ft.), marked by 108 Buddhist shrines, flickering with sacred prayers flags
                    offered by the Buddhist devotees.
                    On a clear day, the pass provides a superb panorama of the snow-capped mountains and the valleys.
                </p>
                <p>From the pass, the road drops slowly through the changing vegetation to the sub-tropical lowlands of
                    the Punakha
                    and Wangdue Valleys. In about 2 and a half hours, we will arrive in&nbsp;<strong>Punakha</strong>
                    where we will stop for lunch.</p>
                <p>We cross&nbsp;<strong>Lawala Pass</strong>&nbsp;and continue on the winding
                    road down to the glacial valley of <strong>Phobjikha</strong> on the slopes of Black
                    Mountains.&nbsp;Phobjikha
                    is a glacial valley on the western slopes of the Black Mountains, bordering the Jigme Singye
                    Wangchuck National
                    t is one of the most important wildlife preserves of Bhutan as the large flock of black-necked
                    cranes migrate here
                    from Siberia, Mongolia and Tibet during the winter time. Usually, the first flock arrives in late
                    October or early
                    November.&nbsp;In addition to the cranes, there are also muntjacs (barking deer), wild boars,
                    sambars, serows,
                    Himalayan black bears, leopards and red foxes in the surrounding hills.</p>
                <p>Today, we first visit the prominent <strong>Gangtey Gompa</strong> of the early 17th century. It is
                    the only
                    Nyingmapa monastery in the region. From here, we jump on the <strong>Gangtey Nature Trail</strong>
                    for an about 2-hours easy hike through the pine forest and the valley. The walk ends over the
                    meandering Chhu
                    Nap ( Black River) near Khewang village where you are picked up by transport.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Upon arrival, check into your accommodation and the rest of the day is at leisure.</p>

                <h4>Day 04~ Explore Phobjika Valley</h4>
                <p>Phobjikha is a glacial valley on the western slopes of the Black Mountains, bordering the Jigme
                    Singye Wangchuck
                    National Park. It is one of the most important wildlife preserves of Bhutan as the large flock of
                    black-necked cranes
                    migrate here from Siberia, Mongolia and Tibet during the winter time. Usually, the first flock
                    arrives in late October or early
                    November.</p>
                <p>In addition to the cranes, there are also muntjacs (barking deer), wild boars, sambars, serows,
                    Himalayan black
                    bears, leopards and red foxes in the surrounding hills.</p>
                <p>After breakfast, one-hour or little longer drive brings us to
                    the trailhead in Gogona village. Visit the local cheese factory and the beautiful temple. The cheese
                    maker produces
                    excellent fresh cheeses based on Swiss cheese making traditions. Maybe you want to purchase some
                    cheese that you can
                    eat along the way for energy The trail goes through rhododendron, magnolia, juniper and bamboo
                    bushes, and if you are
                    lucky, maybe you can spot some wildlife.</p>
                <p>The trail back towards Phobjikha valley starts downwards through the small village and crosses the
                    valley over a
                    beautiful flower meadow. It then continues through mystifying forests up right before the Tshelela
                    Pass where the
                    landscape opens up.
                    From the pass, you continue partly on the dirt road and party on beautiful forest paths downwards
                    and into Phobjikha valley.</p>
                <h4>Day 05~Travel to Trongsa</h4>
                <p> (118 miles, 5 hours)</p>
                <p>Early afternoon, we depart for Trongsa, 118 miles over four to five hours, as we backtrack to the
                    main road and head to the east. The road gradually climbs the Black Mountain Range and
                    crosses Pele-la pass (10,824 feet, or 3,300 meters) where the panoramic views include Mount
                    Jhomolhari on the border with Tibet.</p>
                <p> Below is Trongsa, the hometown of the present rulers of Bhutan. We stop briefly at the Chendebji
                    chorten, a large white monument, which is said to have concealed the remnants of an evil spirit that
                    was vanquished here.</p>
                <p> Re-energized after lunch, visit the majestic Trongsa Dzong that must have captivated your attention
                    already. The Dzong is the former capital and ancestral home of Bhutan's monarchy. An architectural
                    wonder in itself, the fortress currently serves as the headquarter of Trongsa district and a
                    monastery.</p>


                <h4>Day 06~Travel back to Shigatse</h4>
                <p>4980m/16,600 ft., 90km/56miles, 3-4 hrs.<br>

                    visit the base camp, you have a chance this morning, and usually, you have better and unobstructed
                    views in the morning.
                    <br>
                    After breakfast, retrace drive to the main highway and continue on a long journey to Shigatse.<br>

                    the form and necessary supporting documents. Please, initiate the application process in a minimum
                    of three months before
                    the travel date. We need a copy of your Chinese visa forty-five days before the planned arrival date
                    in China. We will obtain
                    the Tibetan Entry permit for you and ship it to your hotel in the gateway city (Chengdu or Beijing).
                    You need to present this
                    document when you check-in for the flight to Lhasa.
                    Your Guide will be holding all other necessary permits required for this trip.</p>
                <h4>Accommodation & meals</h4>
                <p>In Lhasa, we will book a mid-range tourist standard hotel in Barkhor Area. Our choices of hotels are
                    Dhekhang, Kyichu,
                    or Gorkha Hotel, located in the old Tibetan quarter of Lhasa. These are locally managed mid-size
                    properties with an
                    adequate comfort level. There are a few four stars and 5-star hotels such as 4-Points By Sheraton,
                    Shangrila Hotel,
                    St. Regis, etc. and we can book them for you on an additional cost. In Shigatse also, we book a
                    local three-star hotel.
                    Accommodation in Rongbuk is rudimentary. The toilet is a Tibetan style squat with no running water.
                    There is no shower
                    here. Hotels in Tibet provide limited supplies of toiletries, and so, please bring your own set.
                    They may not also have a
                    hairdryer, iron, and ironing boards. If the preferred hotels listed in the program are not
                    available, we will book the
                    next best possible property in that price category.<br>
                    Most hotels in Lhasa and Shigatse provide with WiFi, but some hotels may charge some nominal fee for
                    using the WiFi.
                    Food<br>

                    The trip cost includes breakfast only. The hotels serve Chinese, Tibetan, Indian, Nepali, and
                    western-style breakfasts.
                    The trip does not include lunch and dinner and so budget $10-12 for a meal. You may want to bring
                    some dry fruits, chocolates,
                    energy bars, vitamin supplements, etc.
                </p>

                <h4>Roads and Transportation</h4>
                <p>Now the road in Tibet is in good condition! They are all paved through the basecamp. However,
                    vehicles have to stop at
                    Rongbuk Monastery- the last point you can get by car. Depending on the final group size, we use a
                    minivan or coaster bus all
                    transfers and tours. Bring a protection mask for
                    your nose to avoid inhaling dust! The driver may or may not speak English, but he knows the Tibetan
                    roads and will be an
                    experienced one.</p>
                <h4>Tour Guide</h4>
                <p> You will be accompanied by experienced and knowledgeable English speaking Tibetan Guide who you meet
                    on arrival at Lhasa
                    airport. Besides guiding you on tour, your guide will also be responsible for dealing with check
                    posts, and local bureaucracies and
                    complete necessary paperwork. Guide and driver are different persons.</p>
                <h4>Altitude sickness and Health Issues</h4>
                <p>There are no mandatory vaccinations required for traveling to China and Tibet unless you have visited
                    any yellow fever affected
                    areas in the last six months. However, you may consider protection against rabies Hep A, Typhoid,
                    etc. Travelers with cardiac-pulmonary
                    issues or any other medical conditions are recommended to consult their physician. The primary
                    health consideration in Tibet is altitude-related
                    illness or Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). You may experience some mild symptoms initially, such as
                    headache, lethargy, nausea, and sleeplessness,
                    but these should lessen within a few days.

                    Although the trip doesn't expect you to be athletic, you will be glad if you are fit. So, please,
                    start some physical exercises like jogging,
                    swimming, cycling, hiking, etc. about several weeks before the trip.</p>

                <h4>Booking and cancellation</h4>
                <p>We request a deposit of US$300 along with a completed trip application form and passport copies. If
                    you need us to book the airfare to Lhasa,
                    we will give you the quote.
                    The final payment is due 90 days before the trip date. Balance payment on credit card attracts an
                    additional 3.5% fee.</p>
