                <p>
                    For many travelers who have been to Bhutan and are familiar with its exquisiteness, it
                    may not come
                    as a
                    surprise that Bhutan indeed has been selected as one best travel destination for the
                    upcoming year
                    2020.<br><br>
                    Among other best destinations are England, North Macedonia, Aruba, eSwatini (formerly
                    Swaziland),
                    Costa Rica,
                    The Netherlands, Liberia, Morocco, and Uruguay. These destinations were released by a
                    legendary
                    travel guide
                    Lonely Planet, based on their “topicality, unique experiences and wow factor.” They also
                    take
                    sustainable
                    travel seriously – helping you to have a positive effect wherever you choose to go.
                    Nonetheless,
                    Bhutan has proudly managed to take away the number one spot among these listed
                    countries.

                <h2>Dashain-The largest Nepali Hindu Festival</h2>
                <img src="images/nava_durga_dance.jpg" alt="Nava Durga Dance">
                <p>
                    Dashain or Vijaya Dashami is an auspicious annual festival that is considered one of the
                    most
                    significant
                    festivals in Nepal. Dashain usually falls in the Nepali month of Aswin (September or
                    October)
                    and
                    celebrated
                    by all the Hindus across the world. Dashain begins from bright lunar fortnight (Shukla
                    Paksha)
                    and
                    ends on the
                    full moon day (Poornima) according to the Nepalese annual calendar.<br><br>

                    Dashain is celebrated for fifteen long days, and there is a vast significance of this
                    festival
                    in
                    Hindu mythology. Goddess Durga-
                    the symbol of power- is worshiped during this festival. Dashain is cherished to mark good
                    over
                    evil
                    with the death of a demon
                    called Mahisasur by Goddess Durga. Thereby, the first nine days of Dashain represents the
                    continual
                    battle between the demon
                    and goddess and ultimately defeating the demon on the tenth day.

                <h2>Sri Lanka Offers Free Visa!</h2>
                <img src="images/dambula_cave_temple.jpg" alt="dambula_cave_temple">
                <p>The Tourism Promotion Bureau of Sri Lanka announced a free visa to the travelers of 48
                    countries,
                    including the United States and the offer will be valid for six months, effective from 1st
                    Aug
                    2019.<br><br>

                    Sri Lanka is one of the most beautiful holiday destinations that many people from all around
                    the
                    world
                    prefer to take. Tourism in Sri Lanka’s third-largest and fastest-growing source of foreign
                    currency.
                    But due to the recent unfortunate terrorist attack, the country did face a fall in tourism.
                    Hence,
                    Sri Lanka plans to boost its tourism by allowing travelers from different nations to get a
                    free
                    visa
                    on arrival starting 1st August.<br><br>

                    The Bureau stated that the main aim of offering a free visa is to promote the tourism
                    industry
                    that has
                    collapsed after the terror attacks. The Cabinet of Ministers since have now approved free
                    tourist visa programs to attract more tourists to the country; this measure will be valid
                    for
                    six months as mentioned. </p>
