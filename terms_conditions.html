                <h3>Payment Schedule</h3>
                <p>
                    <em>Tour Deposit</em>: US$ 300 per person<br>

                    If your trip involves internal air tickets, we may have to get the tickets issued within the
                    deadline given by the airlines
                    and we may request you the cost of the ticket along with the tour deposit. After we receive the tour
                    deposit, we process the
                    booking of internal air tickets and hotels and will get back to you with the
                    confirmation within a week. If some internal airfares require immediate purchase, we will ask you to
                    wire the payment.<br>
                    Some hotels and suppliers may ask for a non-refundable deposit to guarantee the booking and we will
                    request to include this in the second payment.</p>

                    <em>Balance payment:</em>

                    The balance and final payment are due 90 days prior to departure. If your trip involves internal air
                    or train tickets,
                    we may also request the cost of the tickets with a booking deposit to guarantee the lowest fare.
                    Credit card payment
                    attracts an additional 3.5% fee. We accept the payment from traveler's account only. However, we
                    reserve the right to
                    refuse certain form of payment. Wire transfer fees are to be borne by the traveler.

                <h3>Cancellation & Refund</h3>
                <p>
                    --60-89 day's prior departure: US$ 300 or 25% of the land cost whichever is higher.<br>
                    --45 days to 59 days prior to departure: US$ 450 or 50% of the land cost whichever is higher.<br>
                    --30 days to 44 days prior to departure: US$ 600 or 75% of the land cost whichever is higher.<br>
                    --Less than 30 days: 100%</p>
                    <p>

                    Cancellation and refund of air tickets cost will be as per rules and regulations of the concerned
                    airlines plus
                    a service charge of US$ 25 per segment will be levied. Cancellation terms and conditions of certain
                    services may
                    vary which will be informed per case to case basis.

                    No refund or adjustment to other services will be made for any unused land or air services for any
                    reason whatsoever,
                    once tour begins. We highly recommend that all travelers purchase trip cancellation insurance.</p>

                    Far & High Adventure Travel (henceforth written as Far & High only), reserves the right to cancel
                    any trip prior to
                    departure for any reason whatsoever, including insufficient signup or logistical problems that may
                    impede trip operations. We also reserve the right to refuse your participation on the tour with or
                    without any reason. So, please do not purchase your international airfare until your participation
                    on the tour is confirmed by us.<br>

                    If a trip is canceled due to force majeure (acts of God, war, labor strikes, earthquake, flooding,
                    government rulesetc.), Far & High will promptly refund the portion of the trip cost not already advanced to
                    suppliers and use its best efforts to recover and refund the balance as promptly as possible. However, 
                    Far & High does not
                    guarantee
                    recovery of any or all of the advance payments made, and our use of best efforts to recover these
                    payments will not
                    include the institution of any legal proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. </p><p>
                    Far & High. is not
                    responsible for expenses
                    incurred by trip members in preparing for a canceled trip (e.g., nonrefundable advance purchase air
                    tickets, visa
                    fees, inoculations, equipment, etc.) or for any additional arrangements should the trip member have
                    embarked prior
                    to the scheduled group departure date. Travel insurance fees, visa fees, and visa handling fees are
                    non-refundable.
                    Since most airline tickets are discounted, refund may be subject to penalty from supplier/airline,
                    may not be in
                    full face value, and may require prepayment of processing fee to Far & High.</p>
